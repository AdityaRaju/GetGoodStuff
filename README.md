GetGoodStuff
============

Chrome Plugin

The chrome extension is developed to let users rate and save the interesting URL's on the web. 
All these ratings will be saved on our DB and will be made available to users across the world. This way, users can find good url's which belong to various domains with out wasting a lot of time finding out the good one's.
